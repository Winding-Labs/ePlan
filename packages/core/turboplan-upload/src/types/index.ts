 * The single source of truth for what may be stored through the upload
 * endpoints. Enforced SERVER-SIDE at presign — the per-call `allowedTypes` on
 * `UploadOptions` is a client-side UX filter and is trivially bypassed by
 * calling `/api/upload/presign` directly.
 *
 * It is an allow list, not a deny list: a deny list of "dangerous" types is
 * always incomplete (`application/*+xml`, `text/*` variants, novel types the
 * browser learns to render), so anything not listed here is refused.
 *
 * Entries are the union of what real call sites need:
 * - images: avatars, organization logos, document logos, chat attachments
 * - documents: project document uploads (PDF / DOC / DOCX)
 * - archives + json: geospatial layer uploads (shapefile zips, GeoJSON)
 * - other GIS files: KMZ, GeoPackage, and KML stored as `text/plain`
 *   (`GIS_UPLOAD_CONTENT_TYPES` in ./project-files is the source)
 *
 * KML's own type (`application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml`) is deliberately NOT
 * listed: browsers render every `+xml` type as an XML document, so a crafted
 * ".kml" holding XHTML would run script from the public storage URL. The
 * map service detects KML by content, so the stored type does not matter.
 *
 * Wildcards (`type/*`) are supported and match the whole category. Adding a
 * type is a one-line change here; do not re-introduce per-endpoint lists.
