/**
 * RBAC guards for the tasks/milestones routers.
 *
 * Tasks and milestones are scoped to a project. By convention the `documentId`
 * column on both tables holds the owning project's id (the client passes
 * `documentId: projectId` for every task/milestone operation), so project
 * membership is resolved from `documentId`.
 *
 * Routes keyed on a project/document id extract it synchronously; routes keyed
 * on a task or milestone id resolve the owning project from that row first. A
 * row id matching nothing gets the same 403 as a denial, so those routes never
 * emit 404 — see `requireEntityPermission` in the rbac package for why.
 *
 * READ routes additionally allow the public-government fallback: any
 * authenticated user may read tasks of a public project owned by a publicly
 * listed organization, as long as the `tasks` module is not hidden/private.
