"turboplan-landing-page": patch
---

Unknown landing-page URLs now return a real 404 status. Before, `/docs/*`,
`/templates/*` and the public catalog under `/projects/*` answered 200 with a
noindex "not found" page, which Search Console reports as soft 404s. The root
layout no longer wraps every page in a Suspense boundary. That boundary let the
200 status go out before a page could call `notFound()`. The navbar's catalog
search and the signup modal read search params, so each now has its own
boundary instead.

Catalog pages also stop treating an API failure as "not found". An
organization, office, project or template page is a 404 only when the public
API says the entity doesn't exist (404, or 400 for a malformed slug). A 5xx or
an unreachable API now renders the error page with a 500, which crawlers retry
and Sentry reports, instead of a 404 that would drop the page from search.
