"turboplan-landing-page": patch
---

Unknown landing-page URLs now return a real 404 status. Before, `/docs/*`,
`/templates/*` and the public catalog under `/projects/*` answered 200 with a
noindex "not found" page, which Search Console reports as soft 404s. The root
layout no longer wraps every page in a Suspense boundary. That boundary let the
200 status go out before a page could call `notFound()`. The navbar's catalog
search and the signup modal read search params, so each now has its own
boundary instead.
